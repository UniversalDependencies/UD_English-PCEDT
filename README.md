# Summary

The English-PCEDT UD treebank is based on the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (PCEDT),
created at the Charles University in Prague.


# Introduction

The underlying texts are from the Wall Street Journal and they
correspond to the sentences annotated in the Penn Treebank.

The morphological and syntactic annotation of the treebank is created
through a conversion of PCEDT data. The conversion procedure has been designed by
Dan Zeman and implemented in Treex.
